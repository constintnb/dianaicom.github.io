  Abstract—The demand for enhanced positioning in complexenvironments 
  has intensified with the integration of 5G NewRadio (NR). Existing 
  algorithms suffer from Non-Line-of-Sight(NLOS) degradation, high 
  signaling overhead, and reducedmultipath accuracy, hindering practical 
  deployment. This paperproposes a reinforcement learning-based positioning 
  methodleveraging 5G reference signals. The algorithm separates localization 
  into angle estimation (via uplink/downlink feedback)and distance measurement 
  using a Weighted Average ReferenceSignal Received Power (WA-RSRP) technique to 
  mitigate noise.The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient 
  (TD3)framework optimizes the accuracy-overhead tradeoff. Simulation 
  results in practical dynamic scenarios demonstrate that: (1)The proposed 
  algorithm reduces error by approximately 70.77%compared to benchmarks 
  at the same signaling overhead level;(2) With a 95% reduction in signaling 
  overhead, the algorithmstill achieves around 30% lower error than baseline 
  approaches.
  Index Terms—Signaling Overhead, 5G Positioning, Reinforcement 
  Learning, 5G Reference Signal.

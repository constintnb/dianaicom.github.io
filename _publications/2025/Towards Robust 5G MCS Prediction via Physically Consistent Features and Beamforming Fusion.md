  Abstract—The rapid evolution of 5G systems has intensified
  demands on physical-layer resources; hence, effective Link
  Adaptation (LA) has been crucial for maintaining reliable, high-
  throughput communications. However, current LA algorithms
  frequently underperform in dynamic wireless environments
  and lack generalization when deployed under conditions that
  differ from their training data. To overcome these limitations,
  we propose a Channel-Aware Beamforming Fusion (CABF)
  framework for robust and generalizable Modulation and Coding
  Scheme (MCS) prediction. Our method extracts physically
  consistent channel representations, builds three complementary
  baseline predictors with distinct design principles, and adap-
  tively combines their outputs using a physics-inspired gated
  fusion mechanism. Simulation results show that this CABF
  framework exhibits strong robustness to environmental changes
  and consistently outperforms conventional benchmarks across
  diverse deployment scenarios.
  Index Terms—Link Adaptation, Modulation and Coding
